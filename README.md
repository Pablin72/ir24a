# Information Retrieval - Escuela Politécnica Nacional - Computación 2024-A

Welcome to the Information Retrieval course for the Bachelor of Science in Computer Science. This repository contains the assignments and hands-on exercises that will help you understand and apply the concepts of Information Retrieval (IR).

## Course Description

This course introduces the fundamental concepts of Information Retrieval systems, including the processing, indexing, and retrieval of textual data. Students will learn about various algorithms and techniques used in search engines, document and query processing, and relevance feedback. The course will also cover recent advancements in IR such as web search, semantic analysis, and information retrieval in big data.

## Prerequisites

- Basic programming skills in Python
- Familiarity with data structures
- Basic knowledge of algorithms

## Course Description
This course addresses advanced aspects of access and information retrieval, focusing on various points: models (probabilistic, vector space, and logical), multimedia indexing, web information retrieval, and its connections with machine learning. This content provides opportunities to introduce students to the processing of a large amount of semi-structured data. The theoretical content is accompanied by examples associated with different applications.

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this course, students will be able to:

1. Understand the architecture of information retrieval systems.
2. Implement basic algorithms for indexing and searching text.
3. Evaluate the effectiveness of IR systems.
4. Apply IR techniques to real-world text processing tasks.
5. Analyze the models related to information retrieval and their application in specific environments.
6. Discriminate the most appropriate retrieval, classification, and clustering strategies for different application cases.
7. Act with ethical and professional responsibility in managing information retrieval systems.

## Course Structure

- **Lectures**: Weekly lectures covering theory and practical applications.
- **Assignments**: Bi-weekly assignments to be completed individually.
- **Hands-On Exercises**: Practical sessions during labs to implement and test IR concepts.
- **Project**: A course-end project focusing on a specific IR challenge.

## Assignments

This section will be regularly updated with assignment descriptions and deadlines. Assignments are intended to be completed using Python and will require the use of specific libraries detailed in each assignment's instructions.

## Hands-On Exercises

Hands-on exercises will be conducted during lab sessions. These exercises are designed to reinforce the theoretical concepts covered in lectures through practical implementation.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using `git clone [[repo-url](https://github.com/ivan-carrera/ir24a.git)]`.
2. Install any required software and libraries as specified in the setup guide for each assignment.
3. Follow the instructions provided in each directory for assignments and exercises.
